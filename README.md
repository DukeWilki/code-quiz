# Retro Gamer Quiz 

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Licence-MIT%20License-yellow"><br>

This assignment was to create a quiz using javascript. I used CSS and Google fonts to give it a retro look of the early 1990s, but I also added modern emojis to hint at modern times. Only the top 5 scores are recorded, but this can be chenged in the javascript slice. As the game is now in version 2, easter eggs have been added and the questions now reflect gaming history.

## Contents
<p>
The app is composed of three files
index.html script.js style.css

## User Story
<p>
    
    AS A coding bootcamp student
    
    I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
    SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
   
</p>

## Acceptance Criteria 
<p>

    WHEN I click the start button
    THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
